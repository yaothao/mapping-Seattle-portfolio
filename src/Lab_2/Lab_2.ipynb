        "In lots of situation, we can get data from popular platforms such as google map, Yelp etc. using their official Web APIs. To use these Web APIs, you will need a developer account for the target platform, and in general, there are QPS and amount limit for the free quota. Of course you can always buy more quota if your want (a little expensive for students).\n",
        "\n",
        "For google and Yelp's APIs such as Yelp's \"Bussiness Search\", each request will just return a small amount of data (the entire data is divied into a bunch of pages), and there is a limitation of the total results you can get in a single research. For example, in Seattle, WA, there may be 30000 restuarants, however in a single search your can get no more than 1000 resturants, and the result is divided into 20 pages, each page contains 50 records (one request, one page). To approximate the real number \"30,000\", you will need advanced techniques such as grid search algorithm or recursive search algorithm. We wouldn't learn about thse advanced techniques in this turtorial, but we will manage to get the allowed max num in one single serach by simply retrieve data in different pages."
