# Looking at Seattle with lens of data

Seattle, also known as the Emerald City, is a vibrant and dynamic city that has been attracting people from all over the world. In this essay, we will explore the inclusive, fast-developing, and happy life characteristics of Seattle by analyzing four different projects.

Project one focuses on the number of international students enrolling at the University of Washington (UW) from winter 2021 to fall 2022. The data reveals that China and India are the top two countries with the most international students studying at UW. This feature also reflects the largest two populations of software developers working in Seattle. Seattle is home to many world-leading technology companies, and foreign-born people who work as software developers in Seattle accounted for 39.8 percent, which ranks third in the United States with the largest number of software programmers (The Seattle Times, 2018). The trend of international students enrolling at UW reflects the demand for skilled workers in the tech industry, and Seattle's thriving tech industry provides a great opportunity for international students to pursue their careers.

Project two analyzed the reviews of ten random restaurants in the Green Lake area, and the results revealed that people enjoy spending time in restaurants at Green Lake. The majority of the customers' reviews were very positive, with many restaurants receiving a 4.5 review or higher. This indicates that people enjoy the food and services provided by the restaurants in the Green Lake area. Additionally, people were very supportive of the restaurants during the pandemic, which shows that the community is closely-knit and cares about each other's well-being (Lemmon, 2020). The support from the community during the tough times demonstrates the inclusiveness and strong sense of community in Seattle.

Project three highlights Seattle's fast-developing nature and its challenges. Seattle has been ranked as the top four growing cities in the US for five years (Seattle.gov, 2018). With major technology companies located in Seattle, over 100,000 people have moved to Seattle since 2010. This growth in population brings many issues to the city, particularly traffic and congestion. The infographic showing the traffic condition recorded from the I-5 southbound on Feb 9th, 2023, illustrates the contrast between the road and vehicles. Seattle's growth has brought challenges, but it also brings opportunities for development and innovation to overcome these challenges.

Project four provides insights into the happy life characteristics of Seattle. The fictional characters visited different places in Seattle, and the majority of them felt happy and positive about their experiences. Among these locations, UW IMA was the most frequently visited, and all of the characters felt positive when they visited. According to a report provided by UW, there are typically 3,000 to 5,000 IMA users on a daily basis, which indicates that UW IMA is a popular and positive experience for students (Ursprunger, 2020). Additionally, UW IMA is inclusive to the public and all groups of people, which reflects Seattle's inclusive nature and diversity.

In conclusion, Seattle is a city that embraces inclusiveness, fast development, and a happy life. The analysis of the four projects highlights the opportunities and challenges that Seattle faces as a city with a fast-growing population and a thriving tech industry. However, the city's inclusiveness, community spirit, and diverse culture make Seattle an excellent place for international students to pursue their careers, people to enjoy dining experiences, and students to engage in physical activities. Seattle's dynamic and vibrant nature is reflected in the many colorful scenes and happy experiences that the city offers.

# Experinces with Project Management
I reflected on their experiences with various steps of project management, including planning, working with data, developing infographics, and narrating the space. In project one, the group aimed to create a Sankey diagram that explores changes in the student population from different countries over time. However, due to the large amount of data needed to create the diagram, we decided to focus on the population difference between each country. My goal was to collect and clean the data, and I identified an opportunity to make this step more efficient by reaching out to obtain access to data sets before collecting data manually.

In project three, our group was unsure of how the infographic would turn out. The resulting visualization made it difficult to distinguish between the vehicle and the road. We reflected on the need to come up with solutions to present a clear illustration of traffic via color, such as intentionally taking photos during peak hours of traffic to observe drastic differences.

In project four, I worked independently on project planning, data collection, analysis, and visualization. The main challenge was data wrangling, as the collected data was not in a good format and did not follow guidelines. I struggled to decide on grouping criteria due to many possibilities, such as location boundaries and word choices in each story. Despite time constraints and limited knowledge, I was able to group entries by exact location names. I identified the opportunity to implement geospatial analysis in the future to group entries based on latitude and longitude.

# Takeaway
The main takeaway from these project experiences is the power of visualization in conveying information and insights from various perspectives. The ability to extract and represent data through visual elements such as colors, charts, and graphs can create a better understanding of complex topics and reveal patterns that might not be easily noticeable through text or numbers alone. Through the projects described, we see how visualizations can be used to explore and communicate data about population trends, traffic congestion, and the emotional associations people have with different locations. These projects demonstrate the potential of visualization to engage and inform audiences in unique ways and the importance of considering different visual strategies to best convey the message intended. Overall, these project experiences highlight the power of visualization to enhance data analysis, decision-making, and communication.

# Future Idea
As a future project, I would like to visualize and narrate the urban development of Seattle over the past decade, with a focus on the changes in the city's architecture and infrastructure. The project would include interactive visualizations, infographics, and maps to showcase the city's development, highlighting the major changes in the urban landscape, such as the construction of new high-rises and public spaces. Additionally, the project would include narratives from the city's residents, architects, and urban planners, providing insights into the city's growth and the challenges it faces in terms of sustainability and livability. The goal of this project would be to showcase Seattle as a dynamic and evolving city, while also raising awareness of the impact of urban development on the environment and the community.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the projects discussed in this essay demonstrate the power of visualization in highlighting important aspects of a city such as population trends, traffic congestion, and cultural diversity. By using different data sources and visualization techniques, we were able to create meaningful representations of the city that shed light on various issues and challenges. The reflections on these projects also reveal the importance of efficient data collection and processing, as well as the need to continually improve visualization methods to enhance their accuracy and effectiveness.

Looking ahead, the future project to visualize and narrate Seattle's urban development over the past decade is an exciting opportunity to explore the city's growth and evolution. By using interactive visualizations, infographics, and maps, this project has the potential to showcase the city's progress while raising awareness of the impact of urban development on the environment and the community. The inclusion of narratives from various stakeholders will provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of urban development in Seattle. Ultimately, this project can serve as a call to action to work towards a more sustainable and livable future for the city. In conclusion, these projects and future project demonstrate the powerful role that visualization can play in shaping our understanding of a city and its future.
